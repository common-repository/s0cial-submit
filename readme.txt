Add buttons for Digg and Reddit to the end of every post.

== Description ==

The s0cial_submit plugin allows you to add buttons for submitting your blog posts to Digg and/or Reddit to the end of every entry.

Note: Configuration options are very slim at the moment.  More features / flexibility to come later.  Please get in touch if you have any immediate needs or suggestions.

== Installation ==

1. Upload 's0cial_submit.php' to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Configure the plugin through its administrator panel in the settings section.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why aren't you using the dynamic buttons? =

Both Digg and Reddit do some strange things in order to generate the dynamic buttons which can often times end up in a) errors and b) ugliness.  There is an option to enable the dynamic Digg buttons but the Reddit buttons are still giving me problems.

== Screenshots ==

None at the moment.
